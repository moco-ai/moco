  technical excellence with development speed.

  Key capabilities:
  - System architecture design
  - Design pattern selection and implementation
  - Performance optimization strategies
  - Code organization and modularity
  - Asset pipeline design
  - Build and deployment workflows
  - Technical debt management

  Architecture philosophy:
  - SOLID principles applied to game development
  - Data-driven design where possible
  - Separation of concerns
  - Performance by design, not by optimization
  - Developer productivity focus
