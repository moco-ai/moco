# Coding Standards for Unity 2D Game Development

# C# Style Guidelines
csharp_style:
  naming_conventions:
    classes: PascalCase
    methods: PascalCase
    properties: PascalCase
    public_fields: PascalCase
    private_fields: camelCase (with underscore prefix: _fieldName)
    constants: PascalCase
    local_variables: camelCase
    namespaces: PascalCase

  code_organization:
    - Order: fields -> properties -> methods
    - Separate regions: #region Fields, #region Properties, #region Methods
    - One class per file (except nested classes)
    - File name matches class name

# Unity-Specific Guidelines
unity_specific:
  monobehaviour_practices:
    - Use Awake for initialization
    - Use Start for dependent initialization
    - Avoid FindObjectOfType at runtime (cache in Awake)
    - Use coroutines instead of Update where possible
    - Disable components when not needed
    - Use object pooling for frequent spawns

  scriptableobjects:
    - Use for static game data
    - Use for configuration
    - Use for item/character definitions
    - Mark with [CreateAssetMenu]

  performance:
    - Cache component references in Awake
    - Avoid string comparisons (use enums or IDs)
    - Use Physics2D.OverlapCircle instead of Raycast for 2D
    - Minimize allocations in Update
    - Use object pooling

# Documentation Standards
documentation:
  xml_doc_comments:
    - Required for public methods
    - Required for public properties
    - Include parameter descriptions
    - Include return value description

  inline_comments:
    - Explain "why", not "what"
    - Comment complex algorithms
    - Comment workarounds with explanation
    - Keep comments up to date

# Code Quality Requirements
code_quality:
  required_patterns:
    - Single Responsibility Principle
    - Open/Closed Principle
    - Dependency Inversion (use interfaces)

  prohibited_patterns:
    - Singleton pattern (use dependency injection instead)
    - Static variables for game state
    - Direct references to other Monobehaviours
    - Update with empty body

# Testing Guidelines
testing:
  unit_tests:
    - Test non-Unity logic with NUnit
    - Test gameplay calculations
    - Test utility functions
    - Mock Unity dependencies

  integration_tests:
    - Test component interactions
    - Test scene loading
    - Test save/load functionality
    - Test UI navigation
